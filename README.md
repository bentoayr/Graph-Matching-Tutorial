# Graph Matching Tutorial

This repository contains the code for the tutorial presented at the 2019, Open Data Science Conference (ODSC) in Boston.

The slides can be found at http://www.jbento.info/slides/GM_Tutorial_ODSC_2019.pdf

The tutorial covers several methods to compare graphs. Some methods can only compare two graphs. Other methods can compare multiple graphs.

The focus of the tutorial are on methods that result in comparison scores that are a metric, or a generalized metric for n obects, and that align the nodes between the graphs in a meaninful way.

This repository contains small snipets of code that illustrate some of the methods discussed in the tutorial.
